Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored here in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](/ETCBC/text-fabric.wiki/File-formats).

These text materials are complex fabrics of text representations and (linguistic) annotations.
In order to work with them, you need software such as 
[Text-Fabric](/ETCBC/text-fabric.wiki)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.
