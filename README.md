Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored here in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/Model/File-formats/).

## [Corpora](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/About/Corpora/)

These text materials are complex fabrics of text representations and (linguistic) annotations.
In order to work with them, you need
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.
