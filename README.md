Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored here in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki/File-formats).

[Available Texts](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/)

These text materials are complex fabrics of text representations and (linguistic) annotations.
In order to work with them, you need software such as 
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.
