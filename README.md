Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/Model/File-formats/).

Fully developed TF data sources can be found here:
[corpora](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/About/Corpora/)

Here you find a few data sources developed as a pilot project.

See the 
[docs](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric-data/).

In order to work with them, you need
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.
