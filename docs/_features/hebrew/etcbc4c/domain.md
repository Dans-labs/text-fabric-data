The domain feature is the most embedded (i.e. the last letter of the) value returned by the feature [txt](txt).
Example: The sequence of characters corresponds with embedding, so a clause having the txt value “QND”, will return the domain “D”.

##### Hint
> Here is a sophisticated query by Oliver Glanz that makes use of this
feature. It detects deviations in a discourse pattern. See the query
on [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/query?id=491).
