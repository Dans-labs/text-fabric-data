**frequency-lexeme**

The frequency of a lexeme, measured as the number of occurrences in the whole Hebrew Bible.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

**NB:**
The ETCBC lexicon makes distinctions between homonyms, i.e. distinct lexemes that are spelled identically.
This feature respects that distinction.

**Hint:**
The measures *frequency* and *rank* have been computed for *lexemes* and *occurrences*.
    
This feature has been added to the database in a later stage as package called `lexicon`.

You can use it in SHEBANQ queries.

If you want to use it in LAF-Fabric, you have to load `lexicon` as *annox*.
Consult the [LAF-Fabric API reference on annoxes](http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/texts/API-reference.html#extra-annotation-packages).
