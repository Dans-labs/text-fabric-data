**name type**


The type of a named entity.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

It is a comma separated list of the following values:

---|---
`pers`   |person
`mens`   |measurement unit
`gens`   |people
`topo`   |place
`ppde`   |demonstrative personal pronoun

This feature has been added to the database in a later stage as package called `lexicon`.

You can use it in SHEBANQ queries.

If you want to use it in LAF-Fabric, you have to load `lexicon` as *annox*.
Consult the [LAF-Fabric API reference on annoxes](http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/texts/API-reference.html#extra-annotation-packages).
