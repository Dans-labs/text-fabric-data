**preformative -consonantal-transliterated**


The consonantal representation of the preformative of a word
[ETCBC transliteration](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/ETCBC4-transcription.pdf).

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

For more about features on morphemes, see [word grammar](wordgrammar).

The preformative is a prefix morpheme. It plays a role in verbal conjugation, and helps
to mark person, number and gender for certain verbal tenses.

**NB:**
One of the values is the empty value. There is also an `absent` value.

To mark *not applicable*, the value `n/a` is used, instead of the usual `NA`.
