**word -pointed-Hebrew (qere)**


The pointed representation of a qere word occurrence in Hebrew script when there is a divergent ketiv.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

When there is a ketiv-qere discrepancy, this feature contains the *vocalized* **qere**.
In all other cases this feature is empty.

See for an example [Genesis 12:8](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/text?book=Genesis&chapter=12&verse=8&tp=txt_p)

# Note
> In cases where the ketiv is different from the qere, the qere has been added to the ETCBC database in a later stage.
Nevertheless, you can use this feature in queries in SHEBANQ.
