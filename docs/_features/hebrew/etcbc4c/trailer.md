**interword material -pointed-transliterated**


The material that follows the word in question, up till the next word.

This feature is present on objects of type [*word*](otype).

The value consists of spaces, newlines, punctuations and special marks that sometimes occur between verses, such as the
*nun hafukha*, and the *samekh* and *pe* markers.

##### Hint
> Not all words in Hebrew are separated by a space.
This feature is the only one that gives the information whether there is a
space between words.
