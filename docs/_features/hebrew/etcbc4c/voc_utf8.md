**vocalized lexeme -pointed-hebrew**

The pointed representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type *lex*.

Only the consonants and vowels of the word lexeme are present: no other diacritical marks.

The values of *vocalized lexeme* look like the values of the [g_lex_utf8](g_lex_utf8) feature
of word occurrences, but they are not the same.
The *vocalized lexeme* is an idealized (aka *paradigmatic*), pointed representation of the lexeme,
which may or may not occur in the text.
The [g_lex_utf8](g_lex_utf8) is the realized lexeme in a concrete occurrence, of which it may be a part.
