**phonetic representation of a word**

This feature is present on objects of type [*word*](otype).

Although it gives the phonetics per word,
its computation has been dependent on the immediate context and even on the wider context of the corpus as a whole.

This is because the know grammatical rules to arrive at the proper pronunciation of Biblical Hebrew
are insufficient and inconsistent.
Many of the problems could be resolved by looking at other occurrences of the same word in the corpus.

It is very well possible that there the phono feature exhibits faulty values.

In order to produce a complete phonetic text representation,
use the [phono_trailer](phono_trailer) feature to produce the material between the words.
