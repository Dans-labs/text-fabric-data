# About

Strong numbers for the
[etcbc4c](/hebrew/etcbc4c/home)
dataset.

The transcription is algorithmically produced by the
[strong notebook](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/blob/master/Versions/strong.ipynb),
on the basis of the
[OpenScriptures Hebrew Lexicon](https://github.com/openscriptures/HebrewLexicon).

Stephen Ku has mapped this resource to the ETCBC4.

By means of
[slot mappings](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/blob/master/Versions/etcbc-versions.ipynb)
between ETCBC versions, the Strong numbers have been added to
newer ETCBC versions as well.

As such it can be seamlessly imported, in all versions, by
[Text-Fabric](/ETCBC/text-fabric).
