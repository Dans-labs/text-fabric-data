**book number**

The number of the present book.

The value is an integer. No quotes required.

This feature is present on objects of type [*bok*](otype).

The books are numbered from 1 (for `matthew`) till 27 (for `revelation`).

This is unlike the original treebanks, where the numbering starts at `40`, making room
for the 39 books of the Hebrew Bible.
