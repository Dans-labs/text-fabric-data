**lexeme -pointed-transliterated**


The pointed representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in 
[ETCBC transliteration](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/ETCBC4-transcription.pdf).

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

The vowels and consonants of the word lexeme are present; a lexeme does not have other diacritical marks.

.. note:: 
    There is no disambiguation material at the end of the value such as in [lex](lex).

**Hint:**
Generally, this is a handy feature to search for specific words.
If you are unsure how exactly the lexeme of a particular word is spelled, it is handy to search in the
[frequency table of values](../index/g_lex)
first. 

**Hint:**
Try also regular expression matching of features, which is supported by MQL. For an example, see [lex](lex).
