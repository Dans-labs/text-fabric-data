**Hint:**
It is difficult to enter Hebrew text. One of the handiest ways to get Hebrew text into a query is to copy and paste it
from some other Hebrew text, e.g. from the [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org).

You could try to copy and paste Hebrew text into a word processor, then remove all diacritics, and paste the result into
your query as a value for [g_lex_utf8](g_lex_utf8).
