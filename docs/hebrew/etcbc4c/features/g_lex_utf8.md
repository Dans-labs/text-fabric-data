Lexeme -pointed-Hebrew ``g_lex_utf8``
-------------------------------------------------------------------
:doc:`frequency table of values <../index/g_lex_utf8>`

The pointed representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

The vowels and consonants of the word lexeme are present; a lexeme does not have other diacritical marks.

.. note:: 
    There is no disambiguation material at the end of the value such as in :doc:`lex <lex>`.

.. hint::
    It is difficult to enter Hebrew text. One of the handiest ways to get Hebrew text into a query is to copy and paste it
    from some other Hebrew text, e.g. from the `SHEBANQ <http://shebanq.ancient-data.org>`_.

    You could try to copy and paste Hebrew text into a word processor, then remove all diacritics, and paste the result into
    your query as a value for :doc:`g_lex_utf8 <g_lex_utf8>`.
