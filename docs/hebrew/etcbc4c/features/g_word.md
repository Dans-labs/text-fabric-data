Word -pointed-transliterated ``g_word``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
:doc:`frequency table of values <../index/g_word>`

The pointed representation of a word occurrence in
`ETCBC transliteration <http://shebanq.ancient-data.org/shebanq/static/docs/ETCBC4-transcription.pdf>`_.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

All characters of the word occurrence are present: consonants, vowel pointing and other diacritical marks.

.. hint::
    It is hazardous to use this feature for queries. From how a Hebrew word looks in printing, it cannot be determined what the
    order of the various diacritics of one and the same consonant is.
    The order, chosen in the ETCBC4 database is such that the rendering gives optimal results for most applications.
    The ETCBC4 is not committed to maintain a definite ordering here.

    In order not to miss search results, it might be helpful to compare the results with those obtained by using
    :doc:`g_cons <g_cons>` instead.

.. hint::
    Here is an example query:
    `setuma and petucha <https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/text?mr=r&qw=q&iid=499>`_ .
