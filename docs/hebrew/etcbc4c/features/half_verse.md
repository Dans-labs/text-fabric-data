# half_verse

**half-verse key**


The key of the present half_verse.

This feature is present on objects of type *half_verse*.

Many verses consist of two parts.
Those parts are called half-verses, and the first one is indicated with *A*, and the second one with *B*.
There are only a few verses with three parts, and the third part is indicated, unsurprisingly, by *C*. 

**NB:**
The half-verse object has no features that specify the verse it occurs in.

When working in LAF, note that half-verses are linked to their verses by unlabelled edges.
