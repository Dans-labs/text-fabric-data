# Instruction `instruction`

The so called instruction of a clause atom.

This feature is present on objects of type *clause_atom*.

The value is something like `.q`, `..`, `.d`, `ve`.

This feature has been added to the database in a later stage as package called `para`.

You can use it in SHEBANQ queries.

If you want to use it in LAF-Fabric, you have to load `para` as *annox*.
Consult the [LAF-Fabric API reference on annoxes](http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/texts/API-reference.html#extra-annotation-packages).

**NB:**
I prefer a more informative definition.

Explain why is this a useful feature? Examples needed.
