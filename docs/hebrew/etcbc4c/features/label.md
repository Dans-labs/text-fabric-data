Verse label ``label``
------------------------------------------------------
:doc:`frequency table of values <../index/label>`

A small string, identifying the present book, chapter and verse.

This feature occurs on objects of type *verse*.

.. hint::
  This feature is a bit tricky to use for searches,
  because there are sometimes leading spaces and sometimes not;
  sometimes there is a space between book and chapter, and sometimes not.
  the abbreviation of the name of the book is not the abbreviation of the latin name of the book.
  We recommend to use the *book*, *chapter*, and *verse* features.
  And, if you decide to use this feature, have a look at the
  :doc:`frequency table of values <../index/label>`
  first.
