# Lexeme -consonantal-Hebrew `lex_utf8`


The consonantal representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

Only the consonants of the lexeme are present: no vowel pointing and no other diacritical marks.

.. note:: 
    There is disambiguation material at the end of the value in the same way as in [lex](lex).

**Hint:**
It is difficult to enter Hebrew text. One of the handiest ways to get Hebrew text into a query is to copy and paste it
from some other Hebrew text, e.g. from the [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org).

You could try to copy and paste Hebrew text into a word processor, then remove all diacritics, and paste the result into
your query as a value for [lex_utf8](lex_utf8).
