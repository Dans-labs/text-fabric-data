The preformative is a prefix morpheme. It plays a role in verbal conjugation, and helps
to mark person, number and gender for certain verbal tenses.

.. note::
    One of the values is the empty value. There is also an ``absent`` value.

    To mark *not applicable*, the value ``n/a`` is used, instead of the usual ``NA``.
