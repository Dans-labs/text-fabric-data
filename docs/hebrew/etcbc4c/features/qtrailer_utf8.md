Interword material -pointed-Hebrew (qere) `qtrailer_utf8`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The material that follows the word in question, up till the next word, but only when occurring in a qere different from the ketiv.

This feature is present on objects of type *word*.

The value consists of spaces, newlines, punctuations and special marks that sometimes occur between verses, such as the
*nun hafukha*, and the *samekh* and *pe* markers.

**Hint:**
Not all words in Hebrew are separated by a space.
This feature is the only one that gives the information whether there is a
space between words.

.. note::
    After the last word of a verse, a newline has been inserted in the ETCBC4 working text.
    This newline has become part of the
    [trailer_utf8](trailer_utf8) value of the last word of the verse.

    This feature is only present with values in UNICODE Hebrew.

This feature has been added to the database in a later stage as package called `lexicon`.

You can use it in SHEBANQ queries.

If you want to use it in LAF-Fabric, you have to load `lexicon` as *annox*.
Consult the [LAF-Fabric API reference on annoxes](http://laf-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/texts/API-reference.html#extra-annotation-packages).
