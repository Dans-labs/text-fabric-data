The verbal ending belongs to verb conjugation and is a signal
that contributes to the determination of gender, number and person.
It does not always determine all these properties completely.

See the frequency table above for which forms signal to which grammatical properties, as far as it possible
to tell.

**NB:**
One of the values is the empty value.

To mark *not applicable*, the value `n/a` is used, instead of the usual `NA`.
