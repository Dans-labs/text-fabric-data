## About

Phonetic transcription of the text in the
[etcbc4c](/hebrew/etcbc4c/home)
database.

The transcription is algorithmically produced by the
[phono notebook](https://rawgit.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/master/phono/phonoTf.html)
that makes use of the corpus as whole.
The notebook provides the result as a *module* to the **etcbc4c** core data.
As such it can be seamlessly imported by
[Text-Fabric](/ETCBC/text-fabric).
