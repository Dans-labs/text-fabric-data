Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored here in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](/ETCBC/text-fabric.wiki/File-formats).

These text materials are complex fabrics of text representations and (linguistic) annotations.
In order to work with them, you need software such as 
[Text-Fabric](/ETCBC/text-fabric.wiki)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.

Here is an overview of the sources currently available.
When you download them, please observe the license conditions.
We do our best to offer all materials freely, with as few restrictions as possible.
The exact conditions differ per data source.
