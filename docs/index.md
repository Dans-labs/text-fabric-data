Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored here in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/fileformats.html).

These text materials are complex fabrics of text representations and (linguistic) annotations.
In order to work with them, you need
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric/tf)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.

Here are the sources that are currently available.
When you download them, please observe the license conditions.
We do our best to offer all materials freely, with as few restrictions as possible.
The exact conditions differ per data source.
