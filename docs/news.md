Added Strong numbers to Hebrew Data

### 2016-12-17

Added the *paragraph* features `pargr` and `instruction` to the etcbc4c dataset.
They were present in the etcbc4b version and on SHEBANQ, but I had left them out
for reasons of time pressure.
Now they are back in.

In order to use them, you have to update your data, which is as simple as

```sh
    cd ~/github/text-fabric-data
    git pull origin master
```

### 2016-12-13

* Adapted the contents of the feature documentation to the new etcbc4c data.
* Added sidebar
* Better layout

### 2016-12-09

* Just started getting the Text-Fabric-Data documentation in place.
