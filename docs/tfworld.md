# TF resources

Here is a list of TF resources outside the ETCBC.

Most of them are *modules*, i.e. bunches of features that can be linked up
against some core dataset.

Modules may provide additions to and corrections on the core dataset,
but they also can provide data of a very different nature, such as
context information, semantic analysis, relevant images etc.

What they have in common is that they can be linked to nodes of the core data. 

# Hebrew modules

# Greek modules

# Other Languages
